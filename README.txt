Contributions: We both worked on it together and both of us did an equal amount of work, we spent a lot of our time just bouncing our ideas off of each other and this helped us a lot in the long run.

Compile/Run: If you are using IntelliJ, you can compile and run our program by pressing Control+R on Mac or you can just press the green play button by the main method.

Bugs: Sometimes you have to resize the window for the full shape to show, and the area of the shape is printed a lot of times.
