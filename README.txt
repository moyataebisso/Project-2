Fractals are geometric patterns that repeat on themselves at smaller and smaller scales. This project uses recursion to draw either circle, rectangle, or square fractals.
Compile/Run: If you are using IntelliJ, you can compile and run our program by pressing Control+R on Mac or you can just press the green play button by the main method. You can also watch the project1vid.mp4 file for a video walkthrough.
Bugs: All three shapes work,but sometimes you have to resize the window for the full shape to show.
